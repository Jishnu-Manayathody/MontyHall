        "\n",
        "The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where you're presented with three closed doors. Behind one door is a prize, while the other two doors hide goats. You choose a door, and then the host, Monty Hall, opens a different door revealing a goat. You're given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that **switching doors** gives you a higher chance of winning the prize. Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of choosing the prize. But when the host reveals a goat, switching increases your chances to 2/3, while sticking maintains your initial 1/3 probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided Python code simulates the Monty Hall problem and demonstrates that the strategy of **switching doors** consistently yields a higher win rate than **sticking with the initial choice**."
